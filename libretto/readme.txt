== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I add widgets? =

Libretto includes an optional footer for widgets. By default, this footer won't be shown unless you add one or more widgets to it. You can add up to four different columns of widgets. Libretto will look best with one or two widgets in each widget area.

Configure these areas by going to Appearance â†’ Widgets in your Dashboard.

= Can I customize my menu? =

You sure can! Libretto supports one menu at the top of the page.

Libretto will support a long menu, but it's happiest if you use shorter menus. For best results, stick to five or six top-level items, and group other links under sub-menus.

= How can I add a site logo? =

Brand your site and make it yours by including your business' logo with Jetpack (http://jetpack.me); navigate to Customize â†’ Site Title and upload a logo image in the space provided. The logo will appear on top of your site title in the header.

The maximum dimension for the logo is 100px (either horizontally or vertically), but you can upload a logo double that size for optimal display on Retina devices. A circular logo will look particularly nice here. If your logo doesn't work well against your header image, try putting it on a circular background using your image editor.

= Does Libretto use featured images? =

Yes! If a Featured Image is set for a post, it will display below the post title, and above the post content, on the blog index and archives. If a Custom Header Image has been set for the site, the Featured Image will also appear in the header area on individual post pages.

Libretto will look great if you use lots of big, beautiful images in your posts. For featured images, 1200 pixels wide is a good starting point, but you may want to upload larger images so they'll display as full-page images at the beginning of your post.

If the images used in your posts are larger than 890 pixels wide, they'll overlap the content area a little bit. Uploading larger images will allow you to showcase them more.

= Does Libretto support Infinite Scroll? =

Libretto includes built-in support for Infinite Scroll. If you're using any footer widgets or the social media nav menu, Infinite Scroll will automatically switch to click-to-load-more mode. In this case, you might prefer to switch Infinite Scroll off and instead use the static pagination included in Libretto for more of a classic, book-like feel.

= Does Libretto have social links? =

If you have social media links you'd like to include in the footer, add them using a custom menu.

1. Create a new Custom Menu, and assign it to the Social Links Menu location
2. Add links to each of your social services using the Links panel
3. Icons for your social links will automatically appear under the heart icon in the header

Full support is automatically included for the following networks: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, Stumbleupon, Reddit, Flickr, Instagram, LinkedIn, Dribbble, Pinterest, Vimeo, and Youtube. Additional networks will appear with a simple star icon. To customize their appearance, you'll need to manually tweak the CSS yourself.

= Can I remove the drop cap effect on paragraphs? =

A drop cap and first-line effect is applied to the first paragraph of standard posts. If you'd like to remove it, you can do so by wrapping your first paragraph with a p tag:

<p class="no-emphasis">Paragraph</p>

If you'd like to apply the styling to a different paragraph, you can do so by wrapping it in this tag:

<p class="emphasis">Paragraph</p>

= Quick Specs (all measurements in pixels) =

1. The main column width is 680.
2. Maximum width for images and overlapping elements is 896.
3. Widgets will vary in width depending on device and the number used, but they range from 242 to 437.
4. The site logo displays at a maximum width and height of 100.
