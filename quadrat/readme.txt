== Description ==

Quadrat is a simple, versatile WordPress theme, designed for blogs and podcasts. Inspired by squared shapes and colourful, minimalist flat illustrations, Quadrat bundles a set of images you can use on your site with the theme’s default color palette. Quadrat’s default styles are bold and playful, relying on a simple sans-serif font and a strong color scheme that you can customize.
