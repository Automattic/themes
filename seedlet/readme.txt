A simple, text-driven theme.

== Description ==

Seedlet is a free WordPress theme. A two-column layout and classically elegant typography creates a refined site that gives your works and images space to breathe - and shine.

Seedlet was built to be the perfect partner to the block editor, and supports all the latest blocks. Writing, audio, illustrations, photography, video - use Seedlet to engage and direct visitors' eyes, without your theme getting in the way. And the responsive design shifts naturally between desktop and mobile devices.

Seedlet is a great option for professionals and creatives looking for a sophisticated vibe. Whether you're looking to create a blog or a robust site promoting your business, do with simplicity, style, and Seedlet.
