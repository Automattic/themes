== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see the Featured Content menu in my customizer, where can I find it? =

To make the Featured Content menu appear in your customizer, you need to install the [Jetpack plugin](http://jetpack.me) because it has the required code needed to make [featured content](http://jetpack.me/support/featured-content/) work for the Canard theme.

Once Jetpack is active, the Featured Content menu will appear in your customizer. No special Jetpack module is needed and a WordPress.com connection is not required for the Featured Content feature to function. Featured Content will work on a localhost installation of WordPress if you add this line to `wp-config.php`:

`define( 'JETPACK_DEV_DEBUG', TRUE );`

= Where can I add widgets? =

Canard offers two widget areas, which can be configured in Appearance → Widgets:

* An optional sidebar widget area, which appears on the right.
* An optional footer widget area.

= How do I add the Social Links to the header? =

Canard allows you display links to your social media profiles, like Twitter and Facebook, with icons.

1. Create a new Custom Menu, and assign it to the Social Links Menu location.
