== Description ==

Vivre is a bold, opinionated blogging theme, heavily inspired by fashion and lifestyle magazines and websites.
With large heavy sans-serif paired with a light elegant serif font, it sets the tone to a refined reading experience.

== Notes ==

This theme was developed using the Gutenberg plugin v13.6.0. Some elements may not work or appear as expected without that version or higher installed.
