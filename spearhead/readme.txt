A theme designed with podcasting in mind with support for dark mode.

== Description ==

Spearhead is a minimal, elegant theme which lets your content speak for itself.

Spearhead comes with some block patterns to help get your podcast up and running. It works seamlessly with the block editor, supporting all the latest blocks â€” audio, illustrations, photography, video, to name a few.

Spearhead has support for dark mode; the default color scheme has a light background, but if your operating system is dark mode the site also changes to use dark background with light text.

Spearhead is a child-theme of Seedlet: https://wordpress.org/themes/seedlet, and was originally donated by Babak Nivi and designed by Cece Yu.
