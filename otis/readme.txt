== Description ==

Otis is a WordPress block theme that is well-suited for personal blogging. It is designed to provide a polished, modern user experience. Its default templates include an opinionated header template with large type, and straightforward single and page templates, which are particularly useful for users who do not want to include images on their site. Otis\' strong design point of view encourages users to follow its design principles. It is focused on simplicity and readability, with a clean and uncluttered layout that allows readers to easily navigate content.
