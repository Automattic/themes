== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see the Testimonial menu in my admin, where can I find it? =

To make the Testimonial menu appear in your admin, you need to install the [Jetpack plugin](http://jetpack.me) because it has the required code needed to make [custom post types](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Post_Types) work for the theme.

Once Jetpack is active, the Testimonial menu will appear in your admin, in addition to standard blog posts. No special Jetpack module is needed and a WordPress.com connection is not required for the Testimonial feature to function. Testimonial will work on a localhost installation of WordPress if you add this line to `wp-config.php`:

`define( 'JETPACK_DEV_DEBUG', TRUE );`

= How to setup the front page like the demo site? =

The demo site URL: http://shoreditchdemo.wordpress.com/?demo

When you first activate Shoreditch, you’ll see your posts in a traditional blog format. If you’d like to use the Panel Page Template as the Front Page of your site, as the demo site does, it’s simple to configure:

1. Create or edit a page, and assign it to the Panel Page Template from the Page Attributes module.
2. Go to Settings > Reading and set “Front page displays” to “A static page”.
3. Select the page you just assigned the Panel Page Template to as “Front page” and set another page as the “Posts page” to display your blog posts.
4. Add some [subpages](https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#To_create_a_subpage) to the page to which you just assigned the Panel Page Template.

== Quick Specs (all measurements in pixels) ==

1. The main column width is 580 except when using the Panel Page Template or Full-Width Page Template where it’s 900.
2. A widget in the sidebar and a widget in the footer when it’s a 3-column layout is 260.
3. A widget in the footer when it’s a one-column layout is 900.
4. A widget in the footer when it’s a two-column layout is 450.
5. Featured Images for posts and pages are 2000 wide by 1500 high.
6. Featured Images for testimonials are 150 wide by 150 high.
