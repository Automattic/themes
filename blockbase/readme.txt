A starting point for building your block-based site.

== Description ==

Blockbase is a simple theme that supports full-site editing. It comes with a set of minimal templates and design settings that can be manipulated through Global Styles. Use it to build something beautiful.

== About Blockbase ==

The purpose of Blockbase is to provide a "ponyfill" that allows for 100% "configuration expression" of design.  Any aspect of configurable design that Gutenberg does not yet take into account is expressed in theme.json 'custom' properties.

To use this theme assign it as the parent theme and then copy from this them to the child theme the theme.json file and fill out the details.

The goal is for the ponyfill styling to reflect what Gutenberg will style, from a given configuration, once that work is complete.  But to offer that today, using simpler techniques that Gutenberg will use upon completion.

== Building a Block Child Theme ==

To build a Blockbase child theme follow these instructions:

- Ensure node/npm are installed on your system.
- From the /blockbase folder run the command `npm run create:child CHILDSLUG`
- A directory with the necessary files will be created to match CHILDSLUG.  This folder will be a sibling of /blockbase.
- From the /CHILDSLUG folder (whatever you decided it would be) run the command `npm run build` any time you make changes to the child-theme.json or any of the files in the /sass folder.
- Your child theme's theme.json file will be built by combining Blockbase's original theme.json file and your child's `child-theme.json`. That is the file where your configuration values live (you only want the values for variables that are different from the parent there). 
- Use the command `npm run start` to enter watch mode to rebuild the assets any time you change child-theme.json or any of the files in /scss.
- Extend the parent's templates that you want to customize or add new ones where needed following the [template hierarchy](https://themeshaper.com/2020/12/18/getting-started-with-block-themes-templates/).

== Building a Universal Child Theme ==

A Universal theme is a theme that works in Full Site Editing and in the Customizer. This is a concept that's still being explored so we don't have instructions to provide yet. If you are curious, you can visit [the project](https://github.com/Automattic/themes/tree/trunk/quadrat) where we are developing Quadrat as a Universal Theme.
