Description: Blockbase is a lightly-opinionated base theme designed for single-page websites. Its single post and page layouts have no header, navigation menus, or widgets by default so the page you design in the WordPress editor is the same page you’ll see on the front end. The theme’s default styles are conservative, relying on simple sans-serif fonts and a subtle blue highlight color. Blockbae is ready for your customizations.
