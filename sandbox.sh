    The branch you are pushing is not up-to-date with /trunk.
    This may result in out-of-date resources on your sandbox.
    How do you wish to proceed?

    1 - Nevermind, I'll merge/rebase my branch first.
        (This option is the safest.)

    2 - Go ahead, I know what I'm doing. I want the old files on my sandbox.
        (This is a good option if you are evaluating an old branch for breakage
         and want to have the sandbox reflect exactly the way it was back then.)

    3 - IGNORE the files changed in /trunk since this branch diverged.
        (This is great during development so that you don't have to keep your
         branch completely up-to-date with /trunk and MIGHT be safe for pushing
         a build.  Use at your own risk.)
