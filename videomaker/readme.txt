== Description ==

Videomaker is a free, minimalistic WordPress theme ideal for film directors and video creators.

It features a variety of block patterns created specifically for film releases and video portfolios, and allows the traditional blogging experience with a single column layout for blog posts.

With simple, customizable typography, and alternative color palettes, Videomaker lets your videos stand out both on desktop and mobile devices.

Videomaker is designed to work with the VideoPress plugin, although it will work well without it.
