Reverie is a theme inspired by the work of Mark Rothko. It features four style variations for each season — Spring (default), Summer, Fall, and Winter. Use it to illuminate your prose, poetry, stories, photos, and more.

Reverie is a block theme interpretation of ma.tt's theme, designed by Joen Asmussen and forked from Twenty Thirteen.
