== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme support any plugins? =

Lodestar includes support for Jetpack's Infinite Scroll and Site Logos, as well as other features.


== Setting Up Your Front Page ==

The page you assigned as your Static Front Page will automatically display a single panel with a full-screen featured image, site logo and/or title, menu, and page content underneath.

You can add more content to your front page by adding panels. Each panel is created from a static page on your site.

To add additional panels to your Front page, follow these steps:

1. Create or edit a page.
2. To add a large image to the top of the panel, assign a Featured Image to the page. This image should be at least 2000 pixels wide and 1200 pixels tall.
3. Publish your page.
4. Navigate to Customize → Theme Options. From the drop-down, select the page you’d like to appear in the panel.
5. For each panel, you also have the option to display the page's content in one or two columns.

Lodestar supports up to four different panels; the theme will only display the panels you add, so you can opt to add fewer.


== Front Page Footer Image ==

The last panel of the front page is an optional full-size image. This can be assigned under Customize → Theme Options → Footer Image.


== Add Header Top Text ==

You can add two strings of text to the top of Lodestar, next to the menu. This allows you to keep your contact information or call to action visible on all pages throughout the site.

To add your own text, navigate to Customize → Theme Options → Header Top Text. It's recommended that you only use short strings of text here. You can include links and other HTML in the Header Top Text fields.


== Portfolio (requires Jetpack: jetpack.me) ==

Lodestar helps you showcase your company's work as portfolio projects. Each project is displayed with its featured image and additional information is displayed on hover.

Once you've added some portfolio projects to your website, they will be visible at http://yourgroovysite.wordpress.com/portfolio.

You can also apply Lodestar's Portfolio Template to a page, which allows visitors to sort your creative works by Project Type. The Portfolio Template will display up to 120 projects. 


== Testimonials (requires Jetpack: jetpack.me) ==

Add testimonials to your Lodestar website to share what others have been saying about your work. You can view the testimonial archive by adding /testimonial to your URL.

You can also apply Lodestar's Testimonial Template to display your testimonials on any page of the site.


== Custom Menus ==

Lodestar includes one Custom Menu in the header, which can be configured via My Sites → Menus. If no menu is assigned, this area will display a list of your pages by default.


== Social Links Menu (requires Jetpack: jetpack.com) ==

With Lodestar, you have the option to display links to your social media profiles in the header and footer. To display them, set up a Social Links Menu.


== Widget Areas ==

Lodestar offers four widget areas:

* The optional Sidebar, which appears on the right on all posts and pages, excluding the static front page.
* Three optional Footer widget areas.

If the Sidebar area is not active, the theme automatically adjusts to have a single column.


== Site Logo ==

Brand identity is very important — that’s why Lodestar supports the Site Logo feature. To add your own image, go to Customize → Site Identity. The logo will appear in the header, above the site title.


== Custom Background ==

Custom color, pattern, or a beautiful image – the choice is yours. To change the background, visit Customize → Colors & Backgrounds from your dashboard.


== Quick Specs (all measurements in pixels) ==
* The main column width is up to 1120 wide on the static front page, and 700 wide on the blog index, archive, single posts, and pages.
* The optional sidebar is up to 336 wide.
* The recommended Featured Image size is at least 2000 wide by 1200 tall. The theme will scale and crop the images depending on the page and device size.
* The recommended Custom Header image size is at least 2000 wide by 1200 tall.
* The Site Logo will display up to 200 tall; larger logo sizes are recommended as they will display sharper on retina devices.
